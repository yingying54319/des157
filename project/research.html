  <p>For my diversity project. I am planning to design a website about the global festivals.
    Therefore, in this research, I reviewed three different websites about festivals.
    The first one was “SF Cherry Blossom Festival celebrates with Grand Parade” by Alejandra Salazar.
    The second one was San Francisco Festivals in 2018 named “Your One Stop Resource for All Festivals & Street Fairs in SF” by Jill Loeffler.
    The last one was called “Best Festivals Around the World in 2017” By Vicki Louise.</p>
    <p>I chose those three festivals which various from the local to global.
      In he local festival about SF Cherry Blossom,
      Salazar displayed a great number of photography about the celebration.
      Under the photo slice show, Salazar provided basic information about the pictures,
      such as the authors’ name with caption.
    This website design with a large image slice show immediately attracted my attention.
    I was pleased by simply looking at the attractive images.
    At the same time, I also learned the background information about the festival as well.
    For the article about the San Francisco Festivals in 2018,
    I notified that Loeffler ordered all the information about the San Francisco festivals in 2018 in a chart or calendar style.
    I was able to review all the festival’s information at once.
     Loeffler also provided the link to purchase the tickets for the festivals under each festival.
     Readers could easily buy the tickets and get more information with one click.
     However, I was wishing there could be more interactive designs in the website.
     Such as animations and videos. </p>
     <p>What I like the most about reading Loeffler’s article was that there was a lot of commons from the visitors and the readers.
     I was able to get ideas and reviews from them as well.
     The last article, titled “Best Festivals Around the World in 2017
”, Louise did a great job on providing a good article by using beautiful visual images and organized information.
Louise talked about each festival one by one with image and words.
This blog article by Louise was speak in the first-person point of view.
Louise was sharing her feeling in the festivals with her readers rather than advertising them.
For example, about the WAKAKUSA YAMAYAKI festival in Nara, Japan.
Louise suggested people to go there in January in case of bad weather.
She was speaking from experience, which made her article so convincing.
What is more, Louise was not only sharing the festival’s experience but also her feeling to the city, country, or even food. I learned a great deal from those three websites. For my incoming website design, I will incorporate those positive elements such as the use of attractive images, well-designed layouts, and academic writing skills.
