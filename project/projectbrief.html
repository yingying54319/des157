      <h1> Project Brief </h1>
      <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
      <p>For the final project, I am planning to build a festival website which provides details global festivals' information such as the date, location, type, review, and brief summary to the viewers. For project 4, I learned to add a map with clickable
        icons/markers/pins, to indicate a specific location with information. For the final project, I will build on my project 4 by adding more information and a search bar on the side. </P>



      <h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
      <p>My target audiences are all people that love to go to the festival, even those who dislike festival, my website is to show them with more information, perhaps, oneday, they will love to go to festival </p>

      <h2>The Goals of the Project</h2>
      <p>There are not much website or app for festival. With more and more people enjoy social but lack information about the event they need to go, I am hoping my site can fill this need. I am also building this website and hoping to advertise the benefit
        of going to the social and cultural event/festival. I believe my website can bring convenience to people. Most importantly, I believe festivals are the new form of culture, or a great way to carry forward tradition, culture, and art.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals for the Overall Look and Feel</h2>
      <p> I do not know much about festival myself. I got all my knowlege about the festival online. In order to add more value to my website, I interviewed serval festival lovers.
