    <p>My first storyboard showed my idea that I wanted to create a website or an app which people could use to get information about music festivals and concerns. The first image in this storyboard showed people using my app at the festivals to interact
      with each other. At the bottom, there was a calendar which people can use to get more information about the festivals. By simply clicking on the calendar, users could get all the information that they need. They could also review the festivals as
      well. I am also hoping I could add a commute function. People could carpool to the festivals. The rest of the sketches were showing people enjoying the show and my design.</p>

    <p>My second storyboard showed that I was hoping to create an interactive music cam. With different music playing, the camera could capture faces and shown them in a funny and silly way. It was inspired by the Snapchat. I was also hoping that I could
      imbed Uber, Lify, and Google Map and combine them in an app. People can easily compare and contrast the transportation prices. </p>
